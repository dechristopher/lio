				Lioctad (li[bre] octad) is a free octad game server focused on realtime gameplay and ease of use.
			</p>
			<p class="prose">
				Octad is a chess variant that was conceived by Andrew DeChristopher in 2018. Rules and information about
				the game can be found below. Octad is thought to be a solved, deterministic game, but needs formal verification
				to prove that.

			<h2>Board Layout</h2>

			<p class="prose">
				Each player begins with four pieces: a knight, their king, and two pawns placed in that order from left to
				right relative to them. An example of this can be seen in the board diagrams below:
			</p>

			<table>
				<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>1. c2</th>
					<th>1. c2 b3</th>
					<th>2. cxb3!</th>
				</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>

			<h2>Rules</h2>

			<p class="prose">
				All standard chess rules apply: en passant is allowed, pawns promote to any piece, and stalemates
				are a draw.
			</p>
			<p class="prose">
				The only catch, however, is that castling is possible between the king and any of its pieces on the starting
				rank before movement. The king will simply switch spaces with the castling piece in all cases except the far
				pawn, in which case the king will travel one space to the right, and the pawn will lie where the king was
				before.
			</p>
			<p class="prose">
				An example of white castling with their far pawn can be expressed as [ 1. c2 b3 2. O-O-O ... ] with the
				resulting structure leaving the knight on a1, a pawn on b1, the king on c1, and the other pawn on c2. Here is
				what that would look like on the board:
			</p>

			<table>
				<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>1. c2</th>
					<th>1. c2 b3</th>
					<th>2. O-O-O</th>
				</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>

			<h2>Octad Forsyth-Edwards Notation (OFEN)</h2>

			<p class="prose">
				Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation (FEN) is a standard notation for describing a particular board position
				of a chess game. The purpose of FEN is to provide all the necessary information to restart a game from a
				particular position.
			</p>

			<p class="prose ul">OFEN is a derivation of FEN to support the features of Octad.</p>
